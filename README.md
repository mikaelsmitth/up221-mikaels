# up221-mikaels
My name is Mikael Smith, I'm a MURP student in the RID concentration. I'm concerned with displacement and tenant rights/organizing (both housed and unhoused).
UP 221 aims to teach the foundations of GIS through Python programming, learning how to prepare spatial data for analysis.
One of my main interests right now is the urban indigenous community, particularly how housing rights and homelessness impacts the community. I think it would be very interesting to work with urban indigenous displacement throughout LA County, as displacement due to development/gentrification is causing what many elders categorize as cultural cleansing. Another interest that I have is spatially mapping areas of environmental hazard, specifically how that interacts with unhoused communities in California/more broadly.
My objectives are to become more familiar with GIS as well as coding more generally. I think it would really aid me in my future research. It is also a goal of mine to research displacement of urban indigenous communities with the hope of incorporating it into research I am doing for other classes.
